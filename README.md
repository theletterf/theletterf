    I write.

    I’ve been writing and exploring tech since I was a kid. At one point, it became my profession, first
    as an editor, then as a content strategist and technical writer. Combining the written word with 
    technology is my passion, especially when I get to build and document new products.

    I’ve a knack for getting things forward in agile ways. I make things happen by connecting with people
    and listening to their stories and needs, turning them into business ideas and requirements. This product
    owner hat served me well over the years—I simply love building stuff (and coding)!
